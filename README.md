# Cdk BreakpointObserver Example Application

The application demonstrates the use of `BreakpointObserver` together with `MediaMatcher` from the `@angular/cdk/layout` package, which provides utilities to build responsive UIs that react to screen-size changes.

By resize browser window, we can observe current screen size changes.
The screen also displays the values (in pixels) for all the breakpoints predefined in the package.
